function S = storage_surface_function(s)
%
% S = storage_surface_function(s)
%
% provides the reservoir surface area (S) as a function of the storage (s)

S = 50000 ; % (m2)
% This is a simple case where the surface area is assumed constant
% (i.e. the reservoir is a cylinder) but it might be replaced by something
% more sophisticate where the surface area actually depend on the reservoir
% level and thus storage.
